# Meme Creator Website
To use this app, clone the git repo onto your computer and navigate to the meme_generator folder using cd in the terminal. Then, use npm i followed by npm start and then open your browser to localhost:3000.

# Creation of the app
This app allows the user to apply text over an random meme themed image fetched from an api, and refresh the image or modify the text. To accomplish this I used react's features of useEffect and useState. This can be seen in the components folder and the Meme.js file.

I also used CSS to format and style the website to look presentable in addition to being functional
